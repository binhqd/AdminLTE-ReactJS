As the name indicates, Images Luxury Nail Lounge provides first class, luxurious services. At Images Luxury Nail Lounge, you can get a manicure unlike no other. At our multiple locations in Newport Beach and Irvine, you have a choice of a convenient location with a luxury menu that includes real diamonds or 24-carat gold nails. Images Luxury Nail Lounge works with a jeweler to get the gems, or you can choose your own jeweler or jewelry to work with instead. Many of our clients have their luxury nails done (at a cost up to $25,000 per set) for weddings, charity events and other formal functions.

In the other extreme, Images Luxury Nail Lounge provides free services for the hospital patients and elementary students. Images Luxury Nail Lounge has also generously supported the causes of many charities in the community.

Images Luxury Nail Lounge has been featured in many mainstream and ethnic media outlets, such as ABC, KTLA, Orange County Register, LA Times, In Style, Herald News, Allure, Nails Magazine, Refinery, Yahoo, Hon Viet TV, Little Saigon Radio, etc.

Images Luxury Nail Loungeâ€™s philosophy is to provide the clients with the best in-store experience with the most glamorous nails and, at the same time, support worthy charitable causes in the community.
